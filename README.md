# UltrasonicPong

Ultrasonic Pong is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game, where you can use ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino board to control the paddles. The game is built in Python using the Pygame library, and it requires an Arduino board, two ultrasonic sensors, and a computer with Python and Pygame installed.

## Installation

## How to Play

The game is played using the two ultrasonic sensors connected to the Arduino board. Move the left paddle up or down by placing your hand closer or further away from the first sensor. Move the right paddle up or down by placing your hand closer or further away from the second sensor.

The objective of the game is to prevent the ball from passing through your side of the screen, while trying to make the ball pass through your opponent's side. The first player to reach a certain number of points wins the game.
